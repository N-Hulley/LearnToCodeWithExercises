# Learn Python

## Getting Started (Required to start lessons/exercises)

### Setting up Python
Download and Install Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (I used version 3.9.0) then restart your computer(Recommended). 
__*I recommend ticking the "Add Python 3.x to PATH"__
__*On the Setup was successful page, clicking "Disable path length limit" might help with future problems__

### Setting up Visual Studio Code
1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Start Visual Studio Code and open the extensions tab. ![Extensions tab in Visual Studio Code](/.assets/00_vscode-extensions.png)

4. Now search for "Jupyter". Select the first option and install it. ![Extensions search bar](/.assets/00_jupyter-search.png)
5. (Recommended) Restart Visual Studio Code. 
6. (Recommended) Click File > Open Folder... then select the python folder and click on the python folder. This will let you easily open the differant notebooks.

### Creating a new Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the Command Palette by clicking (Ctrl + Shift + P) or View > Command Palette or Manage > Command Palette. ![Open Command Palette](python/.assets/00_command-palette-open.png)

## Notes for Exercises
I encourage you to be creative with the tasks and to try things out. If you have any ideas for tasks you'd like to see then [create an issue](https://github.com/N-Hulley/LearnToCodeWithExercises/issues/new)describing the task.

If you are having trouble then make sure you've read through the related lesson or previous lesson. __Note__ - Challenges may require you to do your own research.

If you're still having issues then feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/N-Hulley/LearnToCodeWithExercises/issues/new) and I'll get to you when I can. (Try to explain the issue the best you can, preferebly with screenshots and your code. It would also help if you reference the task you are working on)
